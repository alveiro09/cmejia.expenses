## Expenses

>***ATLAS***
>
> Codename for project solution for IT departments in companies with large distributed workforces that need an IT force multiplier to help provide better and faster service to their customers. IT groups have a problem to solve when work forces are highly distributed, mobile oriented and the size of the IT group is limited. In one example, a region has 30k employees and 115 IT staff members, 20 thousands of those employees are in the field at locations, not near the IT staff. In order to speed up service and increase uptime, IT groups are looking for ways to exchange assets (laptops, phones, tablets, etc.) so that they can issue them to users with down or not working assets, new users or upgrade these as needed. IT groups will also need a way to ensure the return of the old assets in cases where it applies.
